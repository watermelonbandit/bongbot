		<h1>Setup</h1>
		<h2>1. Upon adding the bot to your server, run the command /setup</h2>
		<p>This will initiate the setup process. Enable developer mode in the Discord settings(settings > advanced > Developer Mode)</p>
		<h4>1a. The bot will ask for your timekeeper role. This role is used to determine the role awarded to the user upon successfull aquirement of the "bong"</h4>
		<p> Double check that this role does allow your users to inherit any special permissions if it isnt intended. Go to your role settings and make sure every thing is off, or in the "/" posistion</p>
		<h4>1b. The bot will ask for the lowest role you are comfortable with the bot scanning for the Golden Bong Function</h4>
		<p> In order for the golden bong function to work, the bot needs a random list of channels to send too. To restrict the bot to only the channels you want the golden bong to send too, create a role and add the channels to it manually, or you can restrict the role to catagories to</p>
		<h4>1c. The bot will ask you for a admin role</h4>
		<p>This is NOT your administrator role, unless you really want it to be :). This role can run golden bongs, and refresh the channel list after permission changes are made. This role however will never be able to change the setup permissions</p>
		<h4>1d. The Bot will ask for the bong channel</h4>
		<p> The bong channel is the channel the bot will send the automated bong too. </p>
		<h4>1e. The bong time</h4>
		<p> In order to avoid rate limits, every server can set thier own bong time where the automated bong will take place. Should be any minute between 00 and 59. Must have a leading 0 if the time is between the first minute of the hour and the first 10 minutes of the hour</p>
		<h4><i> Make sure that bong bot is above all roles set so that the bot can manage them effectivly</i></h4>
