# Bongbot, A Discord Application

### Rules

- Get the "bong"- be the first to react to the automated message the bot sends every hour with the clock emoji only after the bot sends it
- Earn the most amount of "bongs" in your server
- Collaborate with your guild mates to earn a spot on the global leaderboard.

### Setup

- Run /setup in your guild (must have the administrator permission)
- fill in the fields in the form that appears
- If the bot detects a issue with the information you inputted it will tell you have to fix it
- After the bot says success, your automated bong will begin that hour, or the next hour if the minute you specified has already past


### Teardown
- Kick the bot from the server. This will wipe all data from the database, so only kick the bot if you are SURE you no longer want to participate in the game.
